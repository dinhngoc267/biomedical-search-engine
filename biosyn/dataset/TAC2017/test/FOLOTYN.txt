    the most common adverse reactions observed in patients with peripheral t-cell lymphoma (ptcl) treated with folotyn were mucositis, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fatigue.
 

   excerpt:   most common adverse reactions (>35%) are mucositis, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fatigue. most common serious adverse reactions are pyrexia, mucositis, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia. (  6.1  )

  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 the safety of folotyn was evaluated in 111 ptcl patients in a single-arm clinical study in which patients received a starting dose of 30 mg/m  2  once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. the median duration of treatment was 70 days (range 1-540 days).



     most frequent adverse reactions  



   table 4  summarizes the most frequent adverse reactions, regardless of causality, using the national cancer institute-common terminology criteria for adverse events (nci ctcae, version 3.0).

                 serious adverse events  
 

 forty-four percent of patients (n = 49) experienced a serious adverse event while on study or within 30 days after their last dose of folotyn. the most common serious adverse events (> 3%), regardless of causality, were pyrexia, mucositis, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia. one death from cardiopulmonary arrest in a patient with mucositis and febrile neutropenia was reported in this trial. deaths from mucositis, febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and pancytopenia occurred in 1.2% of patients treated on all folotyn trials at doses ranging from 30 to 325 mg/m  2  .



     discontinuations  



 twenty-three percent of patients (n = 25) discontinued treatment with folotyn due to adverse reactions. the adverse reactions reported most frequently as the reason for discontinuation of treatment were mucositis (6%, n = 7) and thrombocytopenia (5%, n = 5).



     dose modifications  



 the target dose of folotyn was 30 mg/m  2  once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. the majority of patients (69%, n = 77) remained at the target dose for the duration of treatment. overall, 85% of scheduled doses were administered.



   6.2 post marketing experience

  because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     dermatologic reactions  



 toxic epidermal necrolysis, sometimes fatal, has been reported during post-marketing use of folotyn. fatal cases have been reported following the first dose of folotyn, including when a reduced dose is given, and have been reported in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis [  see warnings and precautions (  5.3  ), use in specific populations (  8.7  ), and clinical pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].
    5 warnings and precautions



   excerpt:    *  thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia: monitor blood counts and omit and/or reduce dose for hematologic toxicities. (  2.2  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  mucositis: monitor at least weekly. if >= grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit and/or reduce dose. (  2.2  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  dermatologic reactions: reactions, including fatal reactions, have occurred and may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. monitor closely, and omit and/or reduce dose or discontinue folotyn. (  2.2  ,  5.3  ) 
 *  tumor lysis syndrome: anticipate, monitor, and treat promptly. (  5.4  ) 
 *  hepatic toxicity: monitor for toxicity. for liver function test abnormalities grade 3 or greater, omit until recovery then reduce dose or discontinue therapy as required. (  2.2  ,  5.5  ) 
 *  risk of increased toxicity with renal impairment: patients with moderate to severe renal function impairment may be at greater risk for increased exposure and toxicity. monitor patients for renal function and systemic toxicity and adjust dosing accordingly. avoid folotyn use in patients with end stage renal disease including those undergoing dialysis unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. (  2.2  ,  5.6  ,  6.2  ) 
 *  embryo-fetal toxicity: women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with folotyn. inform pregnant women of the potential harm to the fetus. (  5.7  ,  8.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 bone marrow suppression



  folotyn can cause bone marrow suppression, manifested by thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia. monitor complete blood counts and omit and/or reduce the dose based on anc and platelet count prior to each dose as outlined in section  2.2     table 2  . administer vitamin b12and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of treatment-related hematological toxicity [ see dosage and administration (  2.1  )(  2.2  ) and adverse reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.2 mucositis



  folotyn can cause mucositis. monitor for mucositis weekly and if >= grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit and/or reduce the dose as outlined in section  2.2     table 1  . administer vitamin b12and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of mucositis [ see dosage and administration (  2.1  )(2.2  ) and adverse reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.3 dermatologic reactions



  folotyn can cause severe dermatologic reactions, which may result in death. these dermatologic reactions have been reported in clinical studies (14/663 patients [2.1%]) and post marketing experience, and have included skin exfoliation, ulceration, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten).  they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment, and may involve skin and subcutaneous sites of known lymphoma.  monitor patients with dermatologic reactions closely, and if severe, withhold or discontinue folotyn [ see adverse reactions (  6.2  ) and use in specific populations (  8.7  )  ].



    5.4 tumor lysis syndrome



  folotyn can cause tumor lysis syndrome (tls). monitor patients who are at increased risk of tls and treat promptly.



    5.5 hepatic toxicity



  folotyn can cause hepatic toxicity and liver function test abnormalities. persistent liver function test abnormalities may be indicators of hepatic toxicity and require dose modification or discontinuation. monitor liver function tests. omit dose until recovery, adjust or discontinue therapy based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity [ see dosage and administration (  2.2  ) and use in specific populations (  8.6  )  ].



       5.6 risk of increased toxicity in the presence of impaired renal function



     patients with moderate to severe renal function impairment may be at greater risk for increased exposure and toxicity. monitor patients for renal function and systemic toxicity and adjust dosing accordingly.



    serious adverse drug reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis and mucositis were reported in patients with end stage renal disease (esrd) undergoing dialysis who were administered folotyn therapy. avoid folotyn use in patients with end stage renal disease including those undergoing dialysis unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [ see dosage and administration (  2.2  ), adverse reactions (  6.2  ), use in specific populations (  8.7  ), and clinical pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].



    5.7 embryo-fetal toxicity



  folotyn can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. folotyn was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits. if this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see use in specific populations (  8.1  )  ].
