  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 the data described in the warnings and precautions section reflect exposure to keytruda in trial 1, an uncontrolled, open-label, multiple cohort trial in which 411 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma received keytruda at either 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks. the median duration of exposure to keytruda was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 24.6 months) with a median of 10 doses (range 1 to 51). the study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range 18 to 94), 39% age 65 years or older, 60% male, 97% white, 73% with m1c disease, 8% with brain metastases, 35% with elevated ldh, 54% with prior exposure to ipilimumab, and 47% with two or more prior systemic therapies for advanced or metastatic disease.



 keytruda was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of the 411 patients. adverse reactions, reported in at least two patients, that led to discontinuation of keytruda were: pneumonitis, renal failure, and pain. serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving keytruda. the most frequent serious adverse drug reactions reported in 2% or more of patients in trial 1 were renal failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cellulitis.



 table 1 presents adverse reactions identified from analyses of the 89 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received keytruda 2 mg/kg every three weeks in one cohort of trial 1. patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and, if braf v600 mutation positive, a braf inhibitor. this cohort of trial 1 excluded patients with severe immune-related toxicity related to ipilimumab, defined as any grade 4 toxicity requiring treatment with corticosteroids or grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease; or any active infection requiring therapy, including hiv or hepatitis b or c. of the 89 patients in this cohort, the median age was 59 years (range 18 to 88), 33% were age 65 years or older, 53% were male, 98% were white, 44% had an elevated ldh, 84% had stage m1c disease, 8% had brain metastases, and 70% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. the median duration of exposure to keytruda was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 15.3 months) with a median of nine doses (range 1 to 23). fifty-one percent of patients were exposed to keytruda for greater than 6 months and 21% for greater than 1 year.



 keytruda was discontinued for adverse reactions in 6% of the 89 patients. the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.

           6.2 immunogenicity
   as with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. because trough levels of pembrolizumab interfere with the electrochemiluminescent (ecl) assay results, a subset analysis was performed in the patients with a concentration of pembrolizumab below the drug tolerance level of the anti-product antibody assay. in this analysis, none of the 97 patients who were treated with 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-pembrolizumab antibodies.



 the detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. for these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to keytruda with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 immune-mediated pneumonitis



  pneumonitis occurred in 12 (2.9%) of 411 melanoma patients, including grade 2 or 3 cases in 8 (1.9%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving keytruda in trial 1. the median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months (range 0.3 weeks to 9.9 months). the median duration was 4.9 months (range 1 week to 14.4 months). five of eight patients with grade 2 and the one patient with grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. the median initial dose of high-dose corticosteroid treatment was 63.4 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent with a median duration of treatment of 3 days (range 1 to 34) followed by a corticosteroid taper. pneumonitis led to discontinuation of keytruda in 3 (0.7%) patients. pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with grade 2-3 pneumonitis.



 monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and administer corticosteroids for grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. withhold keytruda for moderate (grade 2) pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue keytruda for severe (grade 3) or life-threatening (grade 4) pneumonitis [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.2 immune-mediated colitis



  colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred in 4 (1%) of 411 patients, including grade 2 or 3 cases in 1 (0.2%) and 2 (0.5%) patients, respectively, receiving keytruda in trial 1. the median time to onset of colitis was 6.5 months (range 2.3 to 9.8). the median duration was 2.6 months (range 0.6 weeks to 3.6 months). all three patients with grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) with a median initial dose of 70 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of initial treatment was 7 days (range 4 to 41), followed by a corticosteroid taper. one patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of keytruda due to colitis. all four patients with colitis experienced complete resolution of the event.



 monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. administer corticosteroids for grade 2 or greater colitis. withhold keytruda for moderate (grade 2) or severe (grade 3) colitis, and permanently discontinue keytruda for life-threatening (grade 4) colitis [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.3 immune-mediated hepatitis



  hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, including a grade 4 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving keytruda in trial 1. the time to onset was 22 days for the case of grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. the patient with grade 4 hepatitis permanently discontinued keytruda and was treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.



 monitor patients for changes in liver function. administer corticosteroids for grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue keytruda [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.4 immune-mediated endocrinopathies



    hypophysitis    



  hypophysitis occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, consisting of one grade 2 and one grade 4 case (0.2% each), in patients receiving keytruda in trial 1. the time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with grade 2 hypophysitis. both patients were treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remained on a physiologic replacement dose.  



  monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). administer corticosteroids for grade 2 or greater hypophysitis. withhold keytruda for moderate (grade 2) hypophysitis, withhold or discontinue keytruda for severe (grade 3) hypophysitis, and permanently discontinue keytruda for life-threatening (grade 4) hypophysitis [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].    



     thyroid disorders    



  hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 patients, including grade 2 or 3 cases in 2 (0.5%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving keytruda in trial 1. the median time to onset was 1.5 months (range 0.5 to 2.1). the median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). one of two patients with grade 2 and the one patient with grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. one patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of keytruda due to hyperthyroidism. all five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  



  hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 patients, including a grade 3 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving keytruda in trial 1. the median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months (range 0.7 weeks to 19 months). all but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. the other two patients only required short-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. no patient received corticosteroids or discontinued keytruda for management of hypothyroidism.  



  thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  



  administer corticosteroids for grade 3 or greater hyperthyroidism, withhold keytruda for severe (grade 3) hyperthyroidism, and permanently discontinue keytruda for life-threatening (grade 4) hyperthyroidism. isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].    



     type 1 diabetes mellitus    



  type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has occurred in patients receiving keytruda. monitor patients for hyperglycemia and other signs and symptoms of diabetes. administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold keytruda in cases of severe hyperglycemia until metabolic control is achieved [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].    



    5.5 renal failure and immune-mediated nephritis



  nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients, consisting of one case of grade 2 autoimmune nephritis (0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one grade 3 and one grade 4. the time to onset of autoimmune nephritis was 11.6 months after the first dose of keytruda (5 months after the last dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. acute interstitial nephritis was confirmed by renal biopsy in two patients with grades 3-4 renal failure. all three patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper.



 monitor patients for changes in renal function. administer corticosteroids for grade 2 or greater nephritis. withhold keytruda for moderate (grade 2) nephritis, and permanently discontinue keytruda for severe (grade 3), or life-threatening (grade 4) nephritis [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].

  other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur.



 the following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with keytruda in trial 1: exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma.



  across clinical studies with keytruda, the following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions have occurred: severe dermatitis including bullous pemphigoid, myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis.  



  for suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold keytruda and administer corticosteroids. upon improvement to grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. restart keytruda if the adverse reaction remains at grade 1 or less. permanently discontinue keytruda for any severe or grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ].    



    5.7 infusion-related reactions



   infusion-related reactions, including severe and life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving keytruda. monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritis, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. for severe (grade 3) or life-threatening (grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue keytruda [see  dosage and administration (2.2)  ]  .  



    5.8 embryofetal toxicity



  based on its mechanism of action, keytruda may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. animal models link the pd-1/pd-l1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. if this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with keytruda and for 4 months after the last dose of keytruda [see  use in specific populations (8.1  ,  8.8)  ].
