    6. adverse reactions

  excerpt:   the most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on hetlioz than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection (  6.1  )

  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 a total of 1346 subjects were treated with at least one dose of hetlioz, of which 139 were treated for > 26 weeks and 93 were treated for > 1 year.



 a 26-week, parallel-arm placebo-controlled study (study 1) evaluated hetlioz (n=42) compared to placebo (n=42) in patients with non-24. a randomized-withdrawal, placebo- controlled study of 8 weeks duration (study 2) also evaluated hetlioz (n=10), compared to placebo (n=10), in patients with non-24.



 in placebo-controlled studies, 6% of patients exposed to hetlioz discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, compared with 4% of patients who received placebo.



   table 1  shows the incidence of adverse reactions from study 1.




  *adverse reactions with an incidence > 5% and at least twice as high on hetlioz than on placebo are displayed.

    5. warnings and precautions



  excerpt:   may cause somnolence: after taking hetlioz, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed, because hetlioz can impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness (  5.1  )



 



   5.1 somnolence



  after taking hetlioz, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed. hetlioz can potentially impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness.
