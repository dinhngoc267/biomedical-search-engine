  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 the information below is derived from an integrated clinical study database for latuda consisting of 3799 patients exposed to one or more doses of latuda for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression in placebo-controlled studies. this experience corresponds with a total experience of 1250.9 patient-years. a total of 1106 latuda-treated patients had at least 24 weeks and 371 latuda-treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure.



 adverse events during exposure to study treatment were obtained by general inquiry and voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results from physical examinations, vital signs, ecgs, weights and laboratory investigations. adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. in order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using meddra terminology.



     schizophrenia  



 the following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for schizophrenia in which latuda was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 160 mg (n=1508).



     commonly observed adverse reactions:  the most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with latuda were somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea.



     adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment:  a total of 9.5% (143/1508) latuda-treated patients and 9.3% (66/708) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. there were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with latuda that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 2% or more in latuda-treated patients:  adverse reactions associated with the use of latuda (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and latuda incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are shown in  table 15  .

                  dose-related adverse reactions in the schizophrenia studies  
 

 akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were dose-related. the frequency of akathisia increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for latuda 20 mg, 10.7% for latuda 40 mg, 12.3% for latuda 80 mg, and 22.0% for latuda 120 mg). akathisia was reported by 7.4% (9/121) of patients receiving 160 mg/day. akathisia occurred in 3.0% of subjects receiving placebo. the frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for latuda 20 mg, 11.5% for latuda 40 mg, 11.9% for latuda 80 mg, and 22.0% for latuda 120 mg).



     bipolar depression (monotherapy)  



 the following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing study for bipolar depression in which latuda was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg (n=331).



     commonly observed adverse reactions:  the most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5%, in either dose group, and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with latuda were akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anxiety.



     adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment:  a total of 6.0% (20/331) latuda-treated patients and 5.4% (9/168) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. there were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with latuda that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 2% or more in latuda-treated patients:  adverse reactions associated with the use of latuda (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and latuda incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with bipolar depression) are shown in  table 16  .

 in the short-term, placebo-controlled study (involving lower and higher latuda dose ranges) [see clinical studies (  14.2  )] the adverse reactions that occurred with a greater than 5% incidence in the patients treated with latuda in any dose group and greater than placebo in both groups were nausea (10.4%, 17.4%), somnolence (7.3%, 13.8%), akathisia (7.9%, 10.8%), and extrapyramidal symptoms (4.9%, 9.0%) for latuda 20 to 60 mg/day and latuda 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively.



     bipolar depression  



     adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 the following findings are based on two short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for bipolar depression in which latuda was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (n=360).



     commonly observed adverse reactions:  the most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in subjects treated with latuda were akathisia and somnolence.



     adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment:  a total of 5.8% (21/360) latuda-treated patients and 4.8% (16/334) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. there were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with latuda that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 2% or more in latuda-treated patients:  adverse reactions associated with the use of latuda (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and latuda incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with bipolar depression) are shown in  table 17  .

         in the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar depression studies, data was objectively collected on the simpson angus rating scale (sas) for extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), the barnes akathisia scale (bas) for akathisia and the abnormal involuntary movement scale (aims) for dyskinesias.
 

     schizophrenia  



 the mean change from baseline for latuda-treated patients for the sas, bas and aims was comparable to placebo-treated patients, with the exception of the barnes akathisia scale global score (latuda, 0.1; placebo, 0.0). the percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in latuda-treated patients versus placebo for the bas (latuda, 14.4%; placebo, 7.1%), the sas (latuda, 5.0%; placebo, 2.3%) and the aims (latuda, 7.4%; placebo, 5.8%).



     bipolar depression  



     monotherapy  



 the mean change from baseline for latuda-treated patients for the sas, bas and aims was comparable to placebo-treated patients. the percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in latuda-treated patients versus placebo for the bas (latuda, 8.4%; placebo, 5.6%), the sas (latuda, 3.7%; placebo, 1.9%) and the aims (latuda, 3.4%; placebo, 1.2%).



   adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 the mean change from baseline for latuda-treated patients for the sas, bas and aims was comparable to placebo-treated patients. the percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in latuda-treated patients versus placebo for the bas (latuda, 8.7%; placebo, 2.1%), the sas (latuda, 2.8%; placebo, 2.1%) and the aims (latuda, 2.8%; placebo, 0.6%).



     dystonia  



     class effect:  symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. while these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. an elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.



     schizophrenia  



 in the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia clinical studies, dystonia occurred in 4.2% of latuda-treated subjects (0.0% latuda 20 mg, 3.5% latuda 40 mg, 4.5% latuda 80 mg, 6.5% latuda 120 mg and 2.5% latuda 160 mg) compared to 0.8% of subjects receiving placebo. seven subjects (0.5%, 7/1508) discontinued clinical trials due to dystonic events - four were receiving latuda 80 mg/day and three were receiving latuda 120 mg/day.



     bipolar depression  



     monotherapy  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, dystonia occurred in 0.9% of latuda-treated subjects (0.0% and 1.8% for latuda 20 to 60 mg/day and latuda 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively) compared to 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo. no subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events.



     adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, dystonia occurred in 1.1% of latuda-treated subjects (20 to 120 mg) compared to 0.6% of subjects receiving placebo. no subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events.



     other adverse reactions observed during the premarketing evaluation of latuda  



 following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with latuda at multiple doses of >= 20 mg once daily within the premarketing database of 2905 patients with schizophrenia. the reactions listed are those that could be of clinical importance, as well as reactions that are plausibly drug-related on pharmacologic or other grounds. reactions listed in  table 15  or those that appear elsewhere in the latuda label are not included. although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with latuda, they were not necessarily caused by it.



 reactions are further categorized by organ class and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (frequent) (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients (infrequent); and those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients (rare).

   5.1 increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis



  elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6- to 1.7-times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. the extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. latuda is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  boxed warning  ]  .



    5.2 suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults



  patients with major depressive disorder (mdd), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. there has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.



 pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (ssris and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (mdd) and other psychiatric disorders. short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.



 the pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with mdd, obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. the pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with mdd or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. there was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. there were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in mdd. the risk of differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. these risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in  table 2  .

                                                    increases compared to placebo

                                                    decreases compared to placebo                        
 25-64                                              1 fewer case                                         
 >=65                                               6 fewer cases                                        
        no suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. there were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.
 

 it is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. however, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.



  all patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  



 the following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.



 consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.



  families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. prescriptions for latuda should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.  



    5.3 cerebrovascular adverse reactions, including stroke in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis



  in placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. latuda is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see also boxed warning and warnings and precautions (  5.1  )].  



    5.4 neuroleptic malignant syndrome



  a potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (nms) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including latuda.



 clinical manifestations of nms are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.



 the diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (eps). other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.



 the management of nms should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. there is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for nms.



 if a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from nms, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. if reintroduced, the patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of nms have been reported.



    5.5 tardive dyskinesia



  tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements that can develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.



 the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. however, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.



 there is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. the effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.



 given these considerations, latuda should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. in patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. the need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.



 if signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on latuda, drug discontinuation should be considered. however, some patients may require treatment with latuda despite the presence of the syndrome.



    5.6 metabolic changes



  atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. these metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. while all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.



    hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus  



 hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. however, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. because latuda was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if latuda is associated with this increased risk.



 patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. in some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

    5.7 hyperprolactinemia



  as with other drugs that antagonize dopamine d2receptors, latuda elevates prolactin levels.



 hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gnrh, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. this, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients [see adverse reactions (  6  )]  .



 tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. as is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in a latuda carcinogenicity study conducted in rats and mice [see nonclinical toxicology (  13  )].  neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.



  schizophrenia  



 in short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for latuda-treated patients was +0.4 ng/ml and was -1.9 ng/ml in the placebo-treated patients. the median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +0.5 ng/ml and for females was -0.2 ng/ml. median changes for prolactin by dose are shown in  table 12  .

             the proportion of patients with prolactin elevations >= 5* upper limit of normal (uln) was 2.8% for latuda-treated patients versus 1.0% for placebo-treated patients. the proportion of female patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x uln was 5.7% for latuda-treated patients versus 2.0% for placebo-treated female patients. the proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x uln was 1.6% versus 0.6% for placebo-treated male patients.
 

 in the uncontrolled longer-term schizophrenia studies (primarily open-label extension studies), latuda was associated with a median change in prolactin of -0.9 ng/ml at week 24 (n=357), -5.3ng/ml at week 36 (n=190) and -2.2 ng/ml at week 52 (n=307).



    bipolar depression  



    monotherapy  



 the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels, in the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, was +1.7 ng/ml and +3.5 ng/ml with latuda 20 to 60 mg/day and 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively compared to +0.3 ng/ml with placebo-treated patients. the median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +1.5 ng/ml and for females was +3.1 ng/ml. median changes for prolactin by dose range are shown in  table 13  .

 in the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with latuda as monotherapy in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -1.15 ng/ml at week 24 (n=130).



  adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels, in the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies was +2.8 ng/ml with latuda 20 to 120 mg/day compared to 0.0 ng/ml with placebo-treated patients. the median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +2.4 ng/ml and for females was +3.2 ng/ml. median changes for prolactin across the dose range are shown in  table 14  .

 in the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with latuda, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -2.9 ng/ml at week 24 (n=88).



    5.8 leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis



  leukopenia/neutropenia has been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.



 possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (wbc) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. patients with a pre-existing low wbc or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (cbc) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and latuda should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in wbc, in the absence of other causative factors.



 patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm  3  ) should discontinue latuda and have their wbc followed until recovery.



    5.9 orthostatic hypotension and syncope



  latuda may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naive. in such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.



 orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: >= 20 mm hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and >= 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.



    schizophrenia  



 the incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was (latuda incidence, placebo incidence): orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508), 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508), 0% (0/708)].



 in short-term schizophrenia clinical studies, orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with latuda 40 mg, 2.1% with latuda 80 mg, 1.7% with latuda 120 mg and 0.8% with latuda 160 mg compared to 0.7% with placebo.



    bipolar depression  



    monotherapy  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope.



 orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.6% with latuda 20 to 60 mg and 0.6% with latuda 80 to 120 mg compared to 0% with placebo.



  adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression therapy studies, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 1.1% with latuda 20 to 120 mg compared to 0.9% with placebo.



    5.10 seizures



  as with other antipsychotic drugs, latuda should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold, e.g., alzheimer's dementia. conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.



  schizophrenia  



 in short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (2/1508) of patients treated with latuda compared to 0.1% (1/708) placebo-treated patients.



    bipolar depression  



    monotherapy  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions.



    adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions.



    5.11 potential for cognitive and motor impairment



  latuda, like other antipsychotics, has the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with latuda does not affect them adversely.



 in clinical studies with latuda, somnolence included: hypersomnia, hypersomnolence, sedation and somnolence.



    schizophrenia  



 in short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, somnolence was reported by 17.0% (256/1508) of patients treated with latuda (15.5% latuda 20 mg, 15.6% latuda 40 mg, 15.2% latuda 80 mg, 26.5% latuda 120 mg and 8.3% latuda 160 mg/day) compared to 7.1% (50/708) of placebo patients.



    bipolar depression  



    monotherapy  



 in the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, somnolence was reported by 7.3% (12/164) and 13.8% (23/167) with latuda 20 to 60 mg and 80 to120 mg, respectively compared to 6.5% (11/168) of placebo patients.



    adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 in the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, somnolence was reported by 11.4% (41/360) of patients treated with latuda 20-120 mg compared to 5.1% (17/334) of placebo patients.



    5.12 body temperature dysregulation



  disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. appropriate care is advised when prescribing latuda for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration [see patient counseling information (  17.9  )].  



    5.13 suicide



  the possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. prescriptions for latuda should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.



    schizophrenia  



 in short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 0.4% (6/1508) for latuda-treated patients compared to 0.8% (6/708) on placebo. no suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies.



    bipolar depression  



    monotherapy  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 0.0% (0/331) with latuda-treated patients compared to 0.0% (0/168) with placebo-treated patients. no suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in this study.



    adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate  



 in the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 1.1% (4/360) for latuda-treated patients compared to 0.3% (1/334) on placebo. no suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies.



    5.14 activation of mania/hypomania



  antidepressant treatment can increase the risk of developing a manic or hypomanic episode, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder. monitor patients for the emergence of such episodes.



 in the bipolar depression monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (with lithium or valproate) studies, less than 1% of subjects in the latuda and placebo groups developed manic or hypomanic episodes.



    5.15 dysphagia



  esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced alzheimer's dementia. latuda and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.



    5.16 neurological adverse reactions in patients with parkinson's disease or dementia with lewy bodies



  patients with parkinson's disease or dementia with lewy bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. manifestations of this increased sensitivity include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
