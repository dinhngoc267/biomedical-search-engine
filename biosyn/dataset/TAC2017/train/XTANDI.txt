  6.1 clinical trial experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 two randomized clinical trials enrolled patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed on androgen deprivation therapy (gnrh therapy or bilateral orchiectomy), a disease setting that is also defined as metastatic crpc. in both studies, patients received xtandi 160 mg orally once daily in the active treatment arm or placebo in the control arm. all patients continued androgen deprivation therapy. patients were allowed, but not required, to take glucocorticoids.



 the most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) that occurred more commonly (>= 2% over placebo) in the xtandi-treated patients from the two randomized clinical trials were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, diarrhea, hot flush, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral edema, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, weight decreased, headache, hypertension, and dizziness/vertigo.



   study 1: metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following chemotherapy  study 1 enrolled 1199 patients with metastatic crpc who had previously received docetaxel. the median duration of treatment was 8.3 months with xtandi and 3.0 months with placebo. during the trial, 48% of patients on the xtandi arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids.



 grade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of xtandi-treated patients and 53% of placebo-treated patients. discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 16% of xtandi-treated patients and 18% of placebo-treated patients. the most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of the xtandi-treated patients compared to none (0%) of the placebo-treated patients.  table 1  shows adverse reactions reported in study 1 that occurred at a >= 2% higher frequency in the xtandi arm compared to the placebo arm.

             laboratory abnormalities  in the two randomized clinical trials, grade 1-4 neutropenia occurred in 15% of patients treated with xtandi (1% grade 3-4) and in 6% of patients treated with placebo (0.5% grade 3-4). the incidence of grade 1-4 thrombocytopenia was 6% of patients treated with xtandi (0.3% grade 3-4) and 5% of patients treated with placebo (0.5% grade 3-4). grade 1-4 elevations in alt occurred in 10% of patients treated with xtandi (0.2% grade 3-4) and 16% of patients treated with placebo (0.2% grade 3-4). grade 1-4 elevations in bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients treated with xtandi (0.1% grade 3-4) and 2% of patients treated with placebo (no grade 3-4).
 

   infections  in study 1, 1% of patients treated with xtandi compared to 0.3% of patients treated with placebo died from infections or sepsis. in study 2, 1 patient in each treatment group (0.1%) had an infection resulting in death.



   falls and fall-related injuries  in the two randomized clinical trials, falls including fall-related injuries, occurred in 9% of patients treated with xtandi compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure. fall-related injuries were more severe in patients treated with xtandi and included non-pathologic fractures, joint injuries, and hematomas.



   hypertension  in the two randomized trials, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients receiving xtandi and 4% of patients receiving placebo. no patients experienced hypertensive crisis. medical history of hypertension was balanced between arms. hypertension led to study discontinuation in < 1% of patients in each arm.
    5 warnings and precautions



  excerpt:   seizure occurred in 0.9% of patients receiving xtandi who previously received docetaxel and in 0.1% of patients who were chemotherapy-naive. there is no clinical trial experience with xtandi in patients who have had a seizure. permanently discontinue xtandi in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. (  5.1  )



 



   5.1 seizure



   in study 1, which enrolled patients who previously received docetaxel, 7 of 800 (0.9%) patients treated with xtandi experienced a seizure and no patients treated with placebo experienced a seizure. seizure occurred from 31 to 603 days after initiation of xtandi. in study 2, 1 of 871 (0.1%) chemotherapy-naive patients treated with xtandi and 1 of 844 (0.1%) patients treated with placebo experienced a seizure. patients experiencing seizure were permanently discontinued from therapy and all seizure events resolved. there is no clinical trial experience re-administering xtandi to patients who experienced seizure.  



  limited safety data are available in patients with predisposing factors for seizure because these patients were generally excluded from the trials. these exclusion criteria included a history of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past 12 months, cerebral vascular accident, brain metastases, and brain arteriovenous malformation. study 1 excluded the use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold, whereas study 2 permitted the use of these medications.  



  because of the risk of seizure associated with xtandi use, patients should be advised of the risk of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. permanently discontinue xtandi in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.
