  6.1 clinical trial experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 the data below reflect exposure to adcetris as monotherapy in 327 patients with classical hodgkin lymphoma (hl) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (salcl), including 160 patients in two uncontrolled single-arm trials (studies 1 and 2) and 167 patients in one placebo-controlled randomized trial (study 3).



 in studies 1 and 2, the most common adverse reactions (>=20%), regardless of causality, were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough, and vomiting. the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients in either study 1 or 2, regardless of causality, using the nci common toxicity criteria (ctc) version 3.0, are shown in   table 2  .



 in study 3, the most common adverse reactions (>=20%) in the adcetris-treatment arm, regardless of causality, were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, peripheral motor neuropathy, nausea, cough, and diarrhea. the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients, using the nci ctc version 4, are shown in  table 3  .



   experience in classical hodgkin lymphoma  



     summary of clinical trial experience in relapsed classical hl (study 1)    



 adcetris was studied in 102 patients with classical hl in a single arm clinical trial in which the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. median duration of treatment was 9 cycles (range, 1-16)  [see  clinical studies (        14.1        )  ]  .



 the most common adverse reactions (>=20%), regardless of causality, were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, rash, abdominal pain, cough, and vomiting.



     summary of clinical trial experience in classical hl post-auto-hsct consolidation (study 3)    



 adcetris was studied in 329 patients with classical hl at high risk of relapse or progression post-auto-hsct in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg of adcetris administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks or placebo for up to 16 cycles. of the 329 enrolled patients, 327 (167 brentuximab vedotin, 160 placebo) received at least one dose of study treatment. the median number of treatment cycles in each study arm was 15 (range, 1-16) and 80 patients (48%) in the adcetris-treatment arm received 16 cycles  [see  clinical studies (        14.1        )  ]  .



 standard international guidelines were followed for infection prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus (hsv), varicella-zoster virus (vzv), and  pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (pcp) post-auto-hsct. overall, 312 patients (95%) received hsv and vzv prophylaxis with a median duration of 11.1 months (range, 0-20) and 319 patients (98%) received pcp prophylaxis with a median duration of 6.5 months (range, 0-20).



   experience in systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma  



     summary of clinical trial experience in relapsed salcl (study 2)    



 adcetris was studied in 58 patients with salcl in a single arm clinical trial in which the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. median duration of treatment was 7 cycles (range, 1-16)  [see  clinical studies (        14.2        )  ]  .



 the most common adverse reactions (>=20%), regardless of causality, were neutropenia, anemia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, rash, diarrhea, and pain.

        additional important adverse reactions  
 

   peripheral neuropathy  



 in studies 1 and 2, 54% of patients experienced any grade of neuropathy. of these patients, 49% had complete resolution, 31% had partial improvement, and 20% had no improvement. of the patients who reported neuropathy, 51% had residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation.



 in study 3, 67% of patients treated with adcetris experienced any grade of neuropathy. the median time to first onset of any grade was 14 weeks (range, 0.1-47), of grade 2 was 27 weeks (range, 0.4-52) and of grade 3 was 34 weeks (range, 7-106). the median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 23 weeks (range, 0.1-138), of grade 2 was 24 weeks (range, 1-108) and of grade 3 was 25 weeks (range, 2-98). of the patients who reported neuropathy, 59% had complete resolution and 41% had residual neuropathy (26% partial improvement, 15% no improvement) at the time of their last evaluation.



   infusion reactions  



 two cases of anaphylaxis were reported in the dose-finding trials. there were no grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions reported in studies 1 and 2; however, grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions were reported for 19 patients (12%). in studies 1 and 2, the most common adverse reactions (>=2%) associated with infusion-related reactions were chills (4%), nausea (3%), dyspnea (3%), pruritus (3%), pyrexia (2%), and cough (2%).



 in study 3, infusion-related reactions were reported in 25 patients (15%) in the adcetris-treated arm and 3 patients (2%) in the placebo arm. grade 3 events were reported in 3 of the 25 patients treated with adcetris who experienced infusion-related reactions. no grade 4 infusion-related reactions were reported. the most common adverse reactions (>=2%) associated with infusion-related reactions were nausea (4%), chills (4%), dyspnea (2%), headache (2%), pruritus (2%), rash (2%), back pain (2%), and vomiting (2%).



   pulmonary toxicity  



 in a trial in patients with classical hl that studied adcetris with bleomycin as part of a combination regimen, the rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity was higher than the historical incidence reported with abvd (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). patients typically reported cough and dyspnea. interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation were observed on radiographs and computed tomographic imaging of the chest. most patients responded to corticosteroids. the concomitant use of adcetris with bleomycin is contraindicated  [see  contraindications (        4        )  ].  



 cases of pulmonary toxicity have also been reported in patients receiving adcetris. in study 3, pulmonary toxicity was reported in 8 patients (5%) in the adcetris-treated arm and 5 patients (3%) in the placebo arm. a causal association with single-agent adcetris has not been established.



   serious adverse reactions  



 in studies 1 and 2, serious adverse reactions, regardless of causality, were reported in 31% of patients receiving adcetris. the most common serious adverse reactions experienced by patients with classical hl include peripheral motor neuropathy (4%), abdominal pain (3%), pulmonary embolism (2%), pneumonitis (2%), pneumothorax (2%), pyelonephritis (2%), and pyrexia (2%). the most common serious adverse reactions experienced by patients with salcl were septic shock (3%), supraventricular arrhythmia (3%), pain in extremity (3%), and urinary tract infection (3%). other important serious adverse reactions reported include pml, stevens-johnson syndrome, and tumor lysis syndrome.



 in study 3, serious adverse reactions, regardless of causality, were reported in 25% of adcetris-treated patients. the most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), pyrexia (4%), vomiting (3%), nausea (2%), hepatotoxicity (2%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (2%).



   dose modifications  



 adverse reactions that led to dose delays in more than 5% of patients in studies 1 and 2 were neutropenia (14%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (11%)  [see  dosage and administration (        2.2        )  ]  .



 adverse reactions that led to dose delays in more than 5% of adcetris-treated patients in study 3 were neutropenia (22%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (16%), upper respiratory tract infection (6%), and peripheral motor neuropathy (6%)  [see  dosage and administration (        2.2        )  ]  .



   discontinuations  



 adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 21% of patients in studies 1 and 2. adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in 2 or more patients with classical hl or salcl were peripheral sensory neuropathy (8%) and peripheral motor neuropathy (3%).



 adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 32% of adcetris-treated patients in study 3. adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in 2 or more patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy (14%), peripheral motor neuropathy (7%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1%), paraesthesia (1%) and vomiting (1%).



   6.2 post marketing experience

  the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adcetris.  because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   blood and lymphatic system disorders  : febrile neutropenia  [see  warnings and precautions (        5.3        )  ]  .



   hepatobiliary disorders  : hepatotoxicity  [see  warnings and precautions (        5.8        )  ]  .



   infections  : pml  [see  boxed warning,     warnings and precautions (5.9)  ]  , serious infections and opportunistic infections  [see  warnings and precautions (        5.4        )  ]  .



   metabolism and nutrition disorders  : hyperglycemia.



   gastrointestinal disorders  : pancreatitis (including fatal outcomes).  consider the diagnosis of pancreatitis for patients presenting with severe abdominal pain.



   respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  : noninfectious pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and ards (some with fatal outcomes)  [see  warnings and precautions (5.10)  and  adverse reactions (        6.1        )  ]  .



   skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  : toxic epidermal necrolysis, including fatal outcomes  [see  warnings and precautions (5.11)  ]  .



   6.3 immunogenicity

  patients with classical hl and salcl in studies 1 and 2  [see  clinical studies (      14)    ]  were tested for antibodies to brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks using a sensitive electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. approximately 7% of patients in these trials developed persistently positive antibodies (positive test at more than 2 timepoints) and 30% developed transiently positive antibodies (positive in 1 or 2 post-baseline timepoints). the anti-brentuximab antibodies were directed against the antibody component of brentuximab vedotin in all patients with transiently or persistently positive antibodies. two of the patients (1%) with persistently positive antibodies experienced adverse reactions consistent with infusion reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment. overall, a higher incidence of infusion related reactions was observed in patients who developed persistently positive antibodies.



 a total of 58 patient samples that were either transiently or persistently positive for anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. sixty-two percent of these patients had at least one sample that was positive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. the effect of anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies on safety and efficacy is not known.



 immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. for these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to adcetris with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 peripheral neuropathy



  adcetris treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. cases of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been reported. adcetris-induced peripheral neuropathy is cumulative. in the relapsed classical hl and salcl clinical trials, 54% of patients experienced any grade of neuropathy. of these patients, 49% had complete resolution, 31% had partial improvement, and 20% had no improvement. of the patients who reported neuropathy, 51% had residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation. monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of adcetris [see  dosage and administration (       2.2       )  and  adverse reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.2 anaphylaxis and infusion reactions



  infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with adcetris. monitor patients during infusion. if anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue administration of adcetris and administer appropriate medical therapy. if an infusion-related reaction occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate medical management instituted. patients who have experienced a prior infusion-related reaction should be premedicated for subsequent infusions. premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.



    5.3 hematologic toxicities



  prolonged (>=1 week) severe neutropenia and grade 3 or grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with adcetris. febrile neutropenia has been reported with treatment with adcetris. complete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose of adcetris and more frequent monitoring should be considered for patients with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. monitor patients for fever. if grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or g-csf prophylaxis with subsequent adcetris doses [see  dosage and administration (       2.2       )  ]  .



    5.4 serious infections and opportunistic infections



  serious infections and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in patients treated with adcetris. patients should be closely monitored during treatment for the emergence of possible bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.



    5.5 tumor lysis syndrome



  patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden may be at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. monitor closely and take appropriate measures.



     5.6 increased toxicity in the presence of severe renal impairment  



   the frequency of >=grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. due to higher mmae exposure, >=grade 3 adverse reactions may be more frequent in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. avoid the use of adcetris in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (clcr) <30 ml/min] [see  use in specific populations (       8.6       )  ].    



     5.7 increased toxicity in the presence of moderate or severe hepatic impairment  



   the frequency of >=grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. avoid the use of adcetris in patients with moderate (child-pugh b) or severe (child-pugh c) hepatic impairment [see  use in specific populations (       8.7       )  ]  .  



     5.8 hepatotoxicity  



   serious cases of hepatotoxicity, including fatal outcomes, have occurred in patients receiving adcetris. cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin. cases have occurred after the first dose of adcetris or after adcetris rechallenge. preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may also increase the risk. monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. patients experiencing new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of adcetris.   



    5.9 progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy



   jc virus infection resulting in pml and death has been reported in adcetris-treated patients. first onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of adcetris therapy, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. in addition to adcetris therapy, other possible contributory factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. consider the diagnosis of pml in any patient presenting with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. hold adcetris dosing for any suspected case of pml and discontinue adcetris dosing if a diagnosis of pml is confirmed.  



     5.10 pulmonary toxicity  



   events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), some with fatal outcomes, have been reported. monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity, including cough and dyspnea. in the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold adcetris dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.  



     5.11 serious dermatologic reactions  



   stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten), including fatal outcomes, have been reported with adcetris. if sjs or ten occurs, discontinue adcetris and administer appropriate medical therapy.  



    5.12 embryo-fetal toxicity



  there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of adcetris in pregnant women. however, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, adcetris can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. brentuximab vedotin caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including significantly decreased embryo viability and fetal malformations, in animals at maternal exposures that were similar to human exposures at the recommended doses for patients with classical hl and salcl. if this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving the drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see  use in specific populations (       8.1       )  ]  .
