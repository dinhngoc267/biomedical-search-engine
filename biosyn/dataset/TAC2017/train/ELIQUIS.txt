  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 



   reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation

  the safety of eliquis was evaluated in the aristotle and averroes studies  [seeclinical studies (14)]  , including 11,284 patients exposed to eliquis 5 mg twice daily and 602 patients exposed to eliquis 2.5 mg twice daily. the duration of eliquis exposure was >=12 months for 9375 patients and >=24 months for 3369 patients in the two studies. in aristotle, the mean duration of exposure was 89 weeks (>15,000 patient-years). in averroes, the mean duration of exposure was approximately 59 weeks (>3000 patient-years).



 the most common reason for treatment discontinuation in both studies was for bleeding-related adverse reactions; in aristotle this occurred in 1.7% and 2.5% of patients treated with eliquis and warfarin, respectively, and in averroes, in 1.5% and 1.3% on eliquis and aspirin, respectively.

   treatment of dvt and pe and reduction in the risk of recurrence of dvt or pe

  the safety of eliquis has been evaluated in the amplify and amplify-ext studies, including 2676 patients exposed to eliquis 10 mg twice daily, 3359 patients exposed to eliquis 5 mg twice daily, and 840 patients exposed to eliquis 2.5 mg twice daily.



 common adverse reactions (>=1%) were gingival bleeding, epistaxis, contusion, hematuria, rectal hemorrhage, hematoma, menorrhagia, and hemoptysis.



   amplify study

  the mean duration of exposure to eliquis was 154 days and to enoxaparin/warfarin was 152 days in the amplify study. adverse reactions related to bleeding occurred in 417 (15.6%) eliquis-treated patients compared to 661 (24.6%) enoxaparin/warfarin-treated patients. the discontinuation rate due to bleeding events was 0.7% in the eliquis-treated patients compared to 1.7% in enoxaparin/warfarin-treated patients in the amplify study.



 in the amplify study, eliquis was statistically superior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding (relative risk 0.31, 95% ci [0.17, 0.55], p-value <0.0001).

  warning: (a) premature discontinuation of eliquis increases the risk of thrombotic events(b) spinal/epidural hematoma

    (a) premature discontinuation of eliquis increases the risk of thrombotic events  



   premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including eliquis, increases the risk of thrombotic events. if anticoagulation with eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant  



     [see dosage and administration (2.4), warnings and precautions (5.1), and clinical studies (14.1)]  .  



   (b) spinal/epidural hematoma  



   epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with eliquis who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. these hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:  



 *  ?use of indwelling epidural catheters 
 *  ?concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants 
 *  ?a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures 
 *  ?a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery 
 *  ?optimal timing between the administration of eliquis and neuraxial procedures is not known 
        [see warnings and precautions (5.3)]    
 

   monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. if neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary   [see warnings and precautions (5.3)]  .  



   consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated   [see warnings and precautions (5.3)]  .

   see full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   (a) premature discontinuation of eliquis increases the risk of thrombotic events: premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including eliquis, increases the risk of thrombotic events. to reduce this risk, consider coverage with another anticoagulant if eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy.

    5 warnings and precautions

   excerpt:    *  ?  eliquis can cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding. promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss.(5.2) 
 *  ?  prosthetic heart valves: eliquis use not recommended.(5.4) 
    
   5.1 increased risk of thrombotic events after premature discontinuation

  premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including eliquis, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. an increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from eliquis to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. if eliquis is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant  [see    dosage and administration (2.4)    andclinical studies (14.1)]  .



   5.2 bleeding

  eliquis increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding  [see    dosage and administration (2.1)    andadverse reactions (6.1)]  .



 concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. these include aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)  [seedrug interactions (7.3)]  .



 advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. discontinue eliquis in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.



 there is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose, i.e., for about two drug half-lives. a specific antidote for eliquis is not available. hemodialysis does not appear to have a substantial impact on apixaban exposure  [seeclinical pharmacology (12.3)]  . protamine sulfate and vitamin k are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of apixaban. there is no experience with antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals receiving apixaban. there is neither scientific rationale for reversal nor experience with systemic hemostatics (desmopressin and aprotinin) in individuals receiving apixaban. use of procoagulant reversal agents such as prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, or recombinant factor viia may be considered but has not been evaluated in clinical studies. activated oral charcoal reduces absorption of apixaban, thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentration  [seeoverdosage (10)]  .



   5.3 spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture

  when neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.



 the risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of eliquis. the next dose of eliquis should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. the risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. if traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of eliquis for 48 hours.



 monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel, or bladder dysfunction). if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.



   5.4 patients with prosthetic heart valves

  the safety and efficacy of eliquis have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. therefore, use of eliquis is not recommended in these patients.



   5.5 acute pe in hemodynamically unstable patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy

  initiation of eliquis is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with pe who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.
