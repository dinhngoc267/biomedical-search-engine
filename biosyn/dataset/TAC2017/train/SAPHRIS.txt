    the most common adverse reactions (>=5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) reported with acute treatment in adults with schizophrenia were akathisia, oral hypoesthesia, and somnolence. the safety profile of saphris in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults was similar to that seen with acute treatment.
 

 the most common adverse reactions (>=5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) reported with acute monotherapy treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar i disorder in adults were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms other than akathisia, and increased weight and during the adjunctive therapy trial in bipolar i disorder in adults were somnolence and oral hypoesthesia.



 the adult information below is derived from a clinical trial database for saphris consisting of over 4565 patients and/or healthy subjects exposed to one or more sublingual doses of saphris. a total of 1314 saphris-treated patients were treated for at least 24 weeks and 785 saphris-treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure at therapeutic doses.



 in a 3-week monotherapy trial, the most common adverse reactions (>=5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) reported in pediatric patients with bipolar i disorder treated with saphris were somnolence, dizziness, dysgeusia, oral paresthesia, nausea, increased appetite, fatigue, and increased weight. no new major safety findings were reported from a 50-week, open-label, uncontrolled safety trial.



 a total of 651 pediatric patients were treated with saphris. of these patients, 352 pediatric patients were treated with saphris for at least 180 days and 58 pediatric patients treated with saphris had at least 1 year of exposure. the safety of saphris was evaluated in 403 pediatric patients with bipolar i disorder who participated in a 3-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, of whom 302 patients received saphris at fixed doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily.



 the stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. a reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.



   excerpt:   commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence >=5% and at least twice that for placebo) were (6.1):



 *   schizophrenia adults: akathisia, oral hypoesthesia, somnolence. 
 *   bipolar disorder adults (monotherapy): somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms other than akathisia, increased weight. 
 *   bipolar disorder pediatric patients (monotherapy): somnolence, dizziness, dysgeusia, oral paresthesia, nausea, increased appetite, fatigue, increased weight. 
 *   bipolar disorder adults (adjunctive): somnolence, oral hypoesthesia.

  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     adult patients with schizophrenia:  the following findings are based on the short-term placebo-controlled pre-marketing trials for schizophrenia (a pool of three 6-week fixed-dose trials and one 6-week flexible-dose trial) in which sublingual saphris was administered in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg twice daily.



     adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment:  a total of 9% of saphris-treated patients and 10% of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. there were no drug-related adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in patients treated with saphris at the rate of at least 1% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 2% or more in saphris-treated patients with schizophrenia:  adverse reactions associated with the use of saphris (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent, and saphris incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6-weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are shown in  table 8  .

                dose-related adverse reactions:  in the short term pediatric bipolar trials the incidence of fatigue appeared to be dose-related (see  table 10  )
 

     adjunctive therapy in adult patients with bipolar mania:  the following findings are based on a 12 week placebo-controlled trial (with a 3 week efficacy endpoint) in adult patients with bipolar mania in which sublingual saphris was administered in doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.



     adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment:  approximately 16% (25/158) of saphris-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with about 11% (18/166) on placebo. the most common adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with saphris (rates at least 1% and at least twice the placebo rate) were depression (2.5%), suicidal ideation (2.5%), bipolar i disorder (1.9%), insomnia (1.9%) and depressive symptoms (1.3%).



     adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 2% or more among saphris-treated (adjunctive) bipolar patients:  adverse reactions associated with the use of saphris (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent, and saphris incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute adjunctive therapy at 3 weeks, a time when most of the patients were still participating in the trial, are shown in  table 11  .

             dystonia:  symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. while these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. an elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups  [see dosage and administration (2.3), use in specific populations (8.4), and clinical pharmacology (12.3)]  .
 

     extrapyramidal symptoms:  in the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar mania adult trials, data was objectively collected on the simpson angus rating scale for extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), the barnes akathisia scale (for akathisia) and the assessments of involuntary movement scales (for dyskinesias). the mean change from baseline for the all-saphris 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily treated group was comparable to placebo in each of the rating scale scores.



 in the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia adult trials, the incidence of reported eps-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for saphris-treated patients was 10% versus 7% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for saphris-treated patients was 6% versus 3% for placebo. in short-term placebo-controlled bipolar mania adult trials, the incidence of eps-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for saphris-treated patients was 7% versus 2% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for saphris-treated patients was 4% versus 2% for placebo.



 in a 3-week, placebo-controlled pediatric trial with bipolar i disorder, the incidences of eps-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, were 4%, 3%, and 5% for patients treated with saphris 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, as compared to 3% for placebo-treated patients. eps-related events include: bradykinesia, dyskinesia, dystonia, oromandibular dystonia, muscle contractions involuntary, muscle twitching, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, protrusion tongue, resting tremor, and tremor.



 for events of akathisia, incidences were 2%, 2%, and 1% for patients treated with saphris 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, as compared to 0% for placebo-treated patients.



     other findings:  oral hypoesthesia and/or oral paresthesia may occur directly after administration of saphris and usually resolves within 1 hour.



     laboratory test abnormalities:  



     transaminases:  transient elevations in serum transaminases (primarily alt) in the short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania adult trials were more common in treated patients. in short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia adult trials, the mean increase in transaminase levels for saphris-treated patients was 1.6 units/l compared to a decrease of 0.4 units/l for placebo-treated patients. the proportion of patients with transaminase elevations >=3 times uln (at endpoint) was 0.9% for saphris-treated patients versus 1.3% for placebo-treated patients. in short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar adult mania trials, the mean increase in transaminase levels for saphris-treated patients was 8.9 units/l compared to a decrease of 4.9 units/l in placebo-treated patients. the proportion of patients with transaminase elevations >=3 times upper limit of normal (uln) (at endpoint) was 2.5% for saphris-treated patients versus 0.6% for placebo-treated patients.



 in a 52-week, double-blind, comparator-controlled trial that included primarily adult patients with schizophrenia, the mean increase from baseline of alt was 1.7 units/l.



 in a 3-week, placebo-controlled pediatric trial with bipolar i disorder, transient elevations in serum transaminases (primarily alt) were more common in treated patients. the proportion of pediatric patients with alt elevations >=3 times upper limit of normal (uln) was 2.4% for patients treated with saphris 10 mg twice daily versus none for the other saphris dose groups and placebo-treated patients.



     prolactin:  in short-term, placebo-controlled adult schizophrenia trials, the mean decreases in prolactin levels were 6.5 ng/ml for saphris-treated patients compared to 10.7 ng/ml for placebo-treated patients. the proportion of patients with prolactin elevations >=4 times uln (at endpoint) were 2.6% for saphris-treated patients versus 0.6% for placebo-treated patients. in short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania adult trials, the mean increase in prolactin levels was 4.9 ng/ml for saphris-treated patients compared to a decrease of 0.2 ng/ml for placebo-treated patients. the proportion of patients with prolactin elevations >=4 times uln (at endpoint) were 2.3% for saphris-treated patients versus 0.7% for placebo-treated patients.



 in a long-term (52-week), double-blind, comparator-controlled adult trial that included primarily patients with schizophrenia, the mean decrease in prolactin from baseline for saphris-treated patients was 26.9 ng/ml.



 in a 3-week, placebo-controlled pediatric trial with bipolar i disorder, the mean increases (at endpoint) in prolactin levels were 3.2 ng/ml for patients treated with saphris 2.5 mg twice daily, 2.1 ng/ml for patients treated with saphris 5 mg twice daily, and 6.4 ng/ml for patients treated with saphris 10 mg twice daily compared to an increase of 2.5 ng/ml for placebo-treated patients. there were no reports of prolactin elevations >=4 times uln (at endpoint) for patients treated with saphris or placebo. galactorrhea or dysmenorrhea were reported in 0% of patients treated with saphris 2.5 mg twice daily, 2% of patients treated with saphris 5 mg twice daily, and 1% of patients treated with saphris 10 mg twice daily compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. there were no reports of gynecomastia in this trial.



     creatine kinase (ck):  the proportion of adult patients with ck elevations >3 times uln at any time were 6.4% and 11.1% for patients treated with saphris 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, as compared to 6.7% for placebo-treated patients in short-term, fixed-dose trials in schizophrenia and bipolar mania. the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.



 the proportion of patients with ck elevations >=3 times uln during a 3-week trial in pediatric bipolar i disorder at any time were 1%, 0%, and 1% for patients treated with saphris 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, versus 3% for placebo-treated patients.



     other adverse reactions observed during the premarketing evaluation of saphris:  following is a list of meddra terms that reflect adverse reactions reported by patients treated with sublingual saphris at multiple doses of >=5 mg twice daily during any phase of a trial within the database of adult patients. the reactions listed are those that could be of clinical importance, as well as reactions that are plausibly drug-related on pharmacologic or other grounds. reactions already listed for either adults or pediatric patients in other parts of  adverse reactions (6)  , or those considered in  contraindications (4), warnings and precautions (5)  or  overdosage (10)  are not included. reactions are further categorized by meddra system organ class and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (frequent) (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients (infrequent); and those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients (rare).

      6.2 postmarketing experience
   the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of saphris. because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. in many cases, the occurrence of these adverse reactions led to discontinuation of therapy.



 *  application site reactions, primarily in the sublingual area, have been reported. these application site reactions included oral ulcers, blisters, peeling/sloughing, and inflammation. 
 *  choking has been reported by patients, some of whom may have also experienced oropharyngeal muscular dysfunction or hypoesthesia.

 *   neuroleptic malignant syndrome: manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. (5.3) 
 *   tardive dyskinesia: discontinue if clinically appropriate. (5.4) 
 * dispatch: unexpected key: list in dispatch table: {'caption': <function print_caption at 0x1c6c8c0>, 'text': <function print_text at 0x1c6c500>}
  metabolic changes: atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. these metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. (5.5) 
 *   hypersensitivity reactions: hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been observed. (5.6) 
 *   orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and other hemodynamic effects: dizziness, tachycardia or bradycardia, and syncope may occur, especially early in treatment. use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and in antipsychotic-naive patients. (5.7) 
 *   leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotics. patients with a pre-existing low white blood cell count (wbc) or a history of leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (cbc) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and saphris should be discontinued at the first sign of a decline in wbc in the absence of other causative factors.

 *   qt prolongation: increases in qt interval; avoid use with drugs that also increase the qt interval and in patients with risk factors for prolonged qt interval. (5.9) 
 *   seizures: use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. (5.11) 
 *   potential for cognitive and motor impairment: use caution when operating machinery. (5.12) 
 *   suicide: the possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. closely supervise high-risk patients. (5.14) 
    
       5.1 increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis

      elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in the drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times that seen in placebo-treated patients. over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. the extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. saphris is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis  [seeboxed warningand warnings and precautions (5.2)]  .



       5.2 cerebrovascular adverse events, including stroke, in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis

      in placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated subjects. saphris is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis  [see alsoboxed warningand warnings and precautions (5.1)]  .



       5.3 neuroleptic malignant syndrome

      a potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (nms) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including saphris. clinical manifestations of nms are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.



     the diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g. pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (eps). other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.



     the management of nms should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. there is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for nms.



     if a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from nms, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. the patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of nms have been reported.



       5.4 tardive dyskinesia

      a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements can develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia (td) is unknown.



     the risk of developing td and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. however, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.



     there is no known treatment for established cases of td, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. the effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.



     given these considerations, saphris should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of td. chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. in patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. the need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.



     if signs and symptoms of td appear in a patient on saphris, drug discontinuation should be considered. however, some patients may require treatment with saphris despite the presence of the syndrome.



       5.5 metabolic changes

      atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. these metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. while all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.



         hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus  



     hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. however, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics included in these studies. precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.



     patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. in some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug.

     the distance of a z-score from 0 represents the distance of a percentile from the median, measured in standard deviations (sd). after adjusting for age and sex, the mean change from baseline to endpoint in weight z-score for saphrs 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, was 0.11, 0.08 and 0.09 sd versus 0.02 sd for placebo, respectively.



     when treating pediatric patients, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth.

                 5.6 hypersensitivity reactions
       hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in patients treated with saphris. in several cases, these reactions occurred after the first dose. these hypersensitivity reactions included: anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, swollen tongue, dyspnea, wheezing and rash.



       5.7 orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and other hemodynamic effects

      saphris may induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in some patients, especially early in treatment, because of its alpha1-adrenergic antagonist activity. in short-term schizophrenia adult trials, syncope was reported in 0.2% (1/572) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) of saphris, compared to 0.3% (1/378) of patients treated with placebo. in short-term bipolar mania adult trials, syncope was reported in 0.3% (1/379) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) of saphris, compared to 0% (0/203) of patients treated with placebo. during adult pre-marketing clinical trials with saphris, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, syncope was reported in 0.6% (11/1953) of patients treated with saphris. in a 3-week, bipolar mania pediatric trial, syncope was reported in 1% (1/104) of patients treated with saphris 2.5 mg twice daily, 1% (1/99) of patients treated with saphris 5 mg twice daily, and 0% (0/99) for patients treated with saphris 10 mg twice daily compared to 0% (0/101) for patients treated with placebo.



     patients should be instructed about non-pharmacologic interventions that help to reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., sitting on the edge of the bed for several minutes before attempting to stand in the morning and slowly rising from a seated position). saphris should be used with caution in (1) patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications); and (2) in the elderly. saphris should be used cautiously when treating patients who receive treatment with other drugs that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression  [see drug interactions (7.1)]  . monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs.



       5.8 leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis

      in clinical trial and postmarketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including saphris. agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.



     possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (wbc)/absolute neutrophil count (anc) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. in patients with a pre-existing low wbc/anc or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (cbc) frequently during the first few months of therapy. in such patients, consider discontinuation of saphris at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in wbc in the absence of other causative factors.



     monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. discontinue saphris in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm  3  ) and follow their wbc until recovery.



       5.9 qt prolongation

      the effects of saphris on the qt/qtc interval were evaluated in a dedicated adult qt study. this trial involved saphris doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg twice daily, and placebo, and was conducted in 151 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, with electrocardiographic assessments throughout the dosing interval at baseline and steady state. at these doses, saphris was associated with increases in qtc interval ranging from 2 to 5 msec compared to placebo. no patients treated with saphris experienced qtc increases >=60 msec from baseline measurements, nor did any patient experience a qtc of >=500 msec.



     electrocardiogram (ecg) measurements were taken at various time points during the saphris clinical trial program (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily doses). post-baseline qt prolongations exceeding 500 msec were reported at comparable rates for saphris and placebo in these short-term trials. there were no reports of torsade de pointes or any other adverse reactions associated with delayed ventricular repolarization.



     the use of saphris should be avoided in combination with other drugs known to prolong qtc including class 1a antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin). saphris should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias and in other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the qtc interval, including bradycardia; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; and presence of congenital prolongation of the qt interval.



       5.10 hyperprolactinemia

      like other drugs that antagonize dopamine d2receptors, saphris can elevate prolactin levels, and the elevation can persist during chronic administration. hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gnrh, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. this, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. in saphris adult clinical trials, the incidences of adverse events related to abnormal prolactin levels were 0.4% versus 0% for placebo. in a 3-week, bipolar mania pediatric trial, the incidence of adverse events related to abnormal prolactin levels were 0% in the saphris 2.5 mg twice daily treatment group, 2% in the saphris 5 mg twice daily treatment group, and 1% in the saphris 10 mg twice daily treatment group versus to 1% for patients treated with placebo  [see adverse reactions (6.1)]  .



     tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent  in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously-detected breast cancer. neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.



       5.11 seizures

      seizures were reported in 0% and 0.3% (0/572, 1/379) of adult patients treated with doses of 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily of saphris, respectively, compared to 0% (0/503, 0/203) of patients treated with placebo in short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials, respectively. during adult pre-marketing clinical trials with saphris, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, seizures were reported in 0.3% (5/1953) of patients treated with saphris. there were no reports of seizures in pediatric patients treated with saphris in a 3-week-term, bipolar mania trial.



     as with other antipsychotic drugs, saphris should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.



       5.12 potential for cognitive and motor impairment

      somnolence was reported in patients treated with saphris. it was usually transient with the highest incidence reported during the first week of treatment. in short-term, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled schizophrenia adult trials, somnolence was reported in 15% (41/274) of patients on saphris 5 mg twice daily and in 13% (26/208) of patients on saphris 10 mg twice daily compared to 7% (26/378) of placebo patients. in short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania adult trials of therapeutic doses (5-10 mg twice daily), somnolence was reported in 24% (90/379) of patients on saphris compared to 6% (13/203) of placebo patients. during adult pre-marketing clinical trials with saphris, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, somnolence was reported in 18% (358/1953) of patients treated with saphris. somnolence (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.6% (12/1953) of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled trials.



     in a 3-week, placebo-controlled, bipolar i pediatric trial, the incidence of somnolence (including sedation and hypersomnia) for placebo, saphris 2.5 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and 10 mg twice daily, was 12% (12/101), 46% (48/104), 53% (52/99), and 49% (49/99), respectively. somnolence led to discontinuation in 0%, 3%, 1%, and 2% of patients treated with placebo, and saphris 2.5 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively.



     patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that saphris therapy does not affect them adversely.



       5.13 body temperature regulation

      disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. in the short-term placebo-controlled trials for both schizophrenia and acute bipolar disorder, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of body temperature increases was low (<=1%) and comparable to placebo (0%). during clinical trials with saphris, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of body temperature increases (pyrexia and feeling hot) was <=1%.



     appropriate care is advised when prescribing saphris for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.



       5.14 suicide

      the possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses and bipolar disorder, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. prescriptions for saphris should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.



       5.15 dysphagia

  esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. dysphagia was reported in 0.2% and 0% (1/572, 0/379) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5-10 mg twice daily) of saphris as compared to 0% (0/378, 0/203) of patients treated with placebo in short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania adult trials, respectively. during adult pre-marketing clinical trials with saphris, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, dysphagia was reported in 0.1% (2/1953) of patients treated with saphris.



     aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced alzheimer's dementia. saphris is not indicated for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis, and should not be used in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia  [see also warnings and precautions (5.1)]  .



       5.16 use in patients with concomitant illness

      clinical experience with saphris in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited  [see clinical pharmacology (12.3)]  .



     saphris has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. patients with these diagnoses were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials. because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with saphris, caution should be observed in cardiac patients  [see warnings and precautions (5.7)]  .
