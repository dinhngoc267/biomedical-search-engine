  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     cervical dystonia  



 the data described below reflect exposure to dysport    (r)    in 357 cervical dystonia patients in 6 studies. of these, two studies were randomized, double-blind, single treatment, placebo controlled studies with subsequent optional open label treatment in which dose optimization (250 to 1000 units per treatment) over the course of 5 treatment cycles was allowed.



 the population was almost entirely caucasian (99%) with a median age of 51 years (range 18-82 years). most patients (87%) were less than 65 years of age; 58.4% were women.



     common adverse reactions  



 the most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in more than 5% of patients who received 500 units of dysport    (r)    in the placebo controlled clinical trials) in cervical dystonia patients were: muscular weakness, dysphagia, dry mouth, injection site discomfort, fatigue, headache, neck pain, musculoskeletal pain, dysphonia, injection site pain, and eye disorders (consisting of blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity and accommodation). other than injection site reactions, most adverse reactions became noticeable about one week after treatment and lasted several weeks.



 the rates of adverse reactions were higher in the combined controlled and open-label experience than in the placebo-controlled trials. during the clinical studies, two patients (<1%) experienced adverse reactions leading to withdrawal. one patient experienced disturbance in attention, eyelid disorder, feeling abnormal and headache, and one patient experienced dysphagia.



 table 3 compares the incidence of the most frequent adverse reactions from a single treatment cycle of 500 units of dysport    (r)    compared to placebo [  seeclinical studies (14.1)  ].

               injection site reactions  
 

 injection site discomfort and injection site pain were common adverse reactions following dysport    (r)    administration.



     less common adverse reactions  



 the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently (<5%).



     breathing difficulty  



 breathing difficulties were reported by approximately 3% of patients following dysport    (r)    administration and in 1% of placebo patients in clinical trials during the double-blind phase. these consisted mainly of dyspnea. the median time to onset from last dose of dysport    (r)    was approximately one week, and the median duration was approximately three weeks.



 other adverse reactions with incidences of less than 5% in the dysport    (r)    500 units group in the double-blind phase of clinical trials included dizziness in 3.5% of dysport    (r)    -treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients, and muscle atrophy in 1% of dysport    (r)    -treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients.



     laboratory findings  



 patients treated with dysport    (r)    exhibited a small increase from baseline (0.23 mol/l) in mean blood glucose relative to placebo- treated patients. this was not clinically significant among patients in the development program but could be a factor in patients whose diabetes is difficult to control.



     electrocardiographic findings  



 ecg measurements were only recorded in a limited number of patients in an open-label study without a placebo or active control. this study showed a statistically significant reduction in heart rate compared to baseline, averaging about three beats per minute, observed thirty minutes after injection.



     glabellar lines  



 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of dysport    (r)    , the most common adverse reactions(>=2%) following injection of dysport    (r)    were nasopharyngitis, headache, injection site pain, injection site reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, eyelid edema, eyelid ptosis, sinusitis, and nausea.



 table 5 reflects exposure to dysport    (r)    in 398 patients 19 to 75 years of age who were evaluated in the randomized, placebo- controlled clinical studies that assessed the use of dysport    (r)    for the temporary improvement in the appearance of glabellar lines [  seeclinical studies (14)  ]. adverse reactions of any cause occurred in 48% of the dysport    (r)    -treated patients and 33% of the placebo- treated patients.

         in the overall safety database, where some patients received up to twelve treatments with dysport    (r)    , adverse reactions were reported for 57% (1425/2491) of patients. the most frequently reported of these adverse reactions were headache, nasopharyngitis, injection site pain, sinusitis, uri, injection site bruising, and injection site reaction (numbness, discomfort, erythema, tenderness, tingling, itching, stinging, warmth, irritation, tightness, swelling).
 

 adverse reactions that occurred after repeated injections in 2-3% of the population included bronchitis, influenza, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cough, contact dermatitis, injection site swelling, and injection site discomfort.



 the incidence of eyelid ptosis did not increase in the long-term safety studies with multiple re-treatments at intervals >= three months. the majority of the reports of eyelid ptosis were mild to moderate in severity and resolved over several weeks. [  seedosage and administration (2.3)  ].

              injection site reactions  
 

 injection site reactions (e.g. pain, bruising, haemorrhage, injection site erythema/haematoma etc.) have occurred following administration of dysport  (r)  .



     less common adverse reactions  



 in a pooled analysis of clinical studies, adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 2% reported in dysport    (r)    treatment groups included dysphagia 0.5%, gait disturbance 0.5%, hypertonia 0.5%, and sensation of heaviness 0.3%.



   6.2 postmarketing experience

  because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of dysport  (r)  : vertigo, photophobia, influenza-like illness, amyotrophy, burning sensation, facial paresis, hypoesthesia, erythema, and excessive granulation tissue.



   6.3 immunogenicity

  as with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.



 the incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. in addition, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. for these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies across products in this class may be misleading.



     cervical dystonia  



 about 3% of subjects developed antibodies (binding or neutralizing) over time with dysport    (r)    treatment.



     glabellar lines  



 testing for antibodies to dysport    (r)    was performed for 1554 subjects who had up to nine cycles of treatment. two subjects (0.13%) tested positive for binding antibodies at baseline. three additional subjects tested positive for binding antibodies after receiving dysport    (r)    treatment. none of the subjects tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.



     upper limb spasticity  



 from 230 subjects treated with dysport  (r)  and tested for the presence of binding antibodies, 5 subjects were positive at baseline and 17 developed antibodies after treatment. among those 17 subjects, 10 subjects developed neutralizing antibodies. an additional 51 subjects from a separate repeat dose study were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies only. none of the subjects tested positive. in total, from the 281 subjects treated in the long-term studies and tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies, 3.6% developed neutralizing antibodies after treatment.



 in the presence of binding and neutralizing antibodies to dysport  (r)  some patients continue to experience clinical benefit.


    boxed warning: warning: distant spread of toxin effect

  warning: distant spread of toxin effect

    postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of dysport(r) and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. these may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. these symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. the risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. in unapproved uses, including spasticity in children, and in approved indications, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than the maximum recommended total dose. [  see warnings and precautions (5.2)  ]  



   warning: distant spread of toxin effect



   see full prescribing information for complete boxed warning   



   the effects of dysport(r) and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. these symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. the risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms.  
    5 warnings and precautions

   excerpt:    *  the potency units of dysport  (r)  are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of dysport  (r)  cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products (5.1)  
 *  recommended dose and frequency of administration should not be exceeded (5.4) 
 *  immediate medical attention may be required in cases of respiratory, speech or swallowing difficulties (5.3) 
 *  concomitant neuromuscular disorder may exacerbate clinical effects of treatment (5.5) 
 *  dysport   (r)   contains human albumin. there is a risk for transmission of creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd) however, no cases of transmission of viral diseases or cjd have ever been identified for albumin (5.6) 
    
   5.1 lack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products

  the potency units of dysport  (r)  are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. they are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of dysport  (r)  cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [  seedescription (11)  ].



   5.2 spread of toxin effect

  post-marketing safety data from dysport    (r)    and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. the symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. these symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. the risk of the symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. in unapproved uses, including spasticity in children and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than the maximum recommended total dose.



   5.3 dysphagia and breathing difficulties

  treatment with dysport    (r)    and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. patients with pre- existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. in most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or swallowing. when distant effects occur, additional respiratory muscles may be involved [  seewarnings and precautions (5.2)  ].



 deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. dysphagia may persist for several weeks, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised.



 treatment of cervical dystonia with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. this may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. there have been post-marketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure.



 patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. these reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [  seewarnings and precautions (5.2),adverse reactions (6.1),clinical pharmacology (12.2)  ].



   5.4 facial anatomy in the treatment of glabellar lines

  caution should be exercised when administering dysport    (r)    to patients with surgical alterations to the facial anatomy, excessive weakness or atrophy in the target muscle(s), marked facial asymmetry, inflammation at the injection site(s), ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, thick sebaceous skin [  seedosage and administration (2.3  ] or the inability to substantially lessen glabellar lines by physically spreading them apart [  seeclinical studies (14.2)  ].



 do not exceed the recommended dosage and frequency of administration of dysport    (r)    . in clinical trials, subjects who received a higher dose of dysport    (r)    had an increased incidence of eyelid ptosis.



   5.5 pre-existing neuromuscular disorders

  individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or lambert-eaton syndrome) should be monitored particularly closely when given botulinum toxin. patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of dysport    (r)    [  seeadverse reactions (6.1)  ].



   5.6 human albumin

  this product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. a theoretical risk for transmission of creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd) is also considered extremely remote. no cases of transmission of viral diseases or cjd have ever been reported for albumin.



   5.7 intradermal immune reaction

  the possibility of an immune reaction when injected intradermally is unknown. the safety of dysport    (r)    for the treatment of hyperhidrosis has not been established. dysport  (r)  is approved only for intramuscular injection .
