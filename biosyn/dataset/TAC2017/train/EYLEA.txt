  6.1 clinical trials experience

  because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 a total of 2711 patients treated with eylea constituted the safety population in seven phase 3 studies. among those, 2110 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with eylea including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. the most common adverse reactions (>=5%) reported in patients receiving eylea were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous floaters, intraocular pressure increased, and vitreous detachment.



     neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (amd)  



 the data described below reflect exposure to eylea in 1824 patients with wet amd, including 1223 patients treated with the 2-mg dose, in 2 double-masked, active-controlled clinical studies (view1 and view2) for 12 months [  seeclinical studies (14.1)  ].

           less common adverse reactions reported in <1% of the patients treated with eylea were hypersensitivity, retinal detachment, retinal tear, corneal edema, and injection site hemorrhage.
 

   6.2 immunogenicity

  as with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with eylea. the immunogenicity of eylea was evaluated in serum samples. the immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to eylea in immunoassays. the detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. for these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to eylea with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 in the wet amd, rvo, and dme studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to eylea was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. after dosing with eylea for 24-100 weeks, antibodies to eylea were detected in a similar percentage range of patients. there were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity.
    5 warnings and precautions

   excerpt:    *  endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. (5.1) 
 *  increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. (5.2) 
 *  there is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of vegf inhibitors. (5.3) 
    
   5.1 endophthalmitis and retinal detachments

  intravitreal injections, including those with eylea, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [  seeadverse reactions (6.1)  ]. proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering eylea. patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately [  seedosage and administration (2.7)andpatient counseling information (17)  ].



   5.2 increase in intraocular pressure

  acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with eylea [  seeadverse reactions (6.1)  ]. sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) inhibitors. intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [  seedosage and administration (2.7)  ].



   5.3 thromboembolic events

    there is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ates) following intravitreal use of vegf inhibitors, including eylea. ates are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). the incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet amd studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with eylea. the incidence in the dme studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with eylea compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with eylea compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. there were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with eylea in the first six months of the rvo studies.
